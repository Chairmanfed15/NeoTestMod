THE NOXERNA
=
The Noxerna is a planet far in the depths of the universe, where it is only safe(r) in the deep, dark cave systems. 
Explore an abandoned mining operation from an industrious civilisation, 
the tragedy of a culture reduced to ashes, 
ruins of grand kingdoms lost to the shadows of time, 
and maybe even brave the dangers that terrorise the Noxerna’s surface. 
Just kidding, the star is a deadly laser, and the night’s toxic blanket won’t save you either.
